Shouldn't infix calls be expressions as well?
Normal calls are... 


Refactor match ... Err(err) => Err(err) to let smth = self.func()?;
Refactor long parse matches to try_parse_* functions
Refactor function and infix parsing to smaller functions
Allow function types in parse_type


Pass to transform infix passes to normal calls.
Pass which infers function types.
